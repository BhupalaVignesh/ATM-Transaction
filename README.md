# ATM-Transaction
This project simulates a basic ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system using the C programming language. It allows users to perform common banking transactions such as checking account balance, withdrawing cash, depositing money, and viewing transaction history through a console-based interface. The goal of this project is to demonstrate core programming concepts like file handling, conditional logic, loops, and user interaction.
